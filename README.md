# Login on behalf of another user

Logging to your app as another user is a useful feature for developers, account administrators or support personnel to asist customers experiencing issues.

This code is an example of how you can create this functionality from scratch on top of an existing authentication system. The code uses devise for authentication, but the impplementation is agnostic, so it doesn't matter what you're existing login system is using.
